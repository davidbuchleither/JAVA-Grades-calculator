# JAVA-Grades-calculator



# Introduction, goals, boundary conditions

Our project is a grade calculator, which enables the user to get a complete overview of his study achievements.

The user has the possibility to create individual modules and to equip them with subordinate subjects.

The grades obtained during the studies can be used in the languages German, French and Swiss German. 

The student receives his grades in all 3 country scales.

The passed modules are highlighted in green, the failed modules in red. 

In addition, it is possible to save the scores that have been earned and inserted.
